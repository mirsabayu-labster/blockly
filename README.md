# Blockly [![Build Status]( https://travis-ci.org/google/blockly.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/blockly)

To Test. download or clone from Labster Development goto Labster/index.html (open it with chrome or firefox). play with the blocks,!! (the generated xml is shown in the console (still left out the cosmetics :D ) - gonna work on it if it necessary.

core development left :

labster simulation xml to blockly xml converter.
goals : native IDE for labster simulation script development.

blocks to simulation
simulation to blocks
search for blocks
debug blocks
benefit ::

boost readibility
speed up our script writing process
decrease human error
can be developed to make it more integrated in our pipeline. Like native simulation scripting.



Google's Blockly is a web-based, visual programming editor.  Users can drag
blocks together to build programs.  All code is free and open source.

Blockly has an active [developer forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/blockly). Please drop by and say hello. Show us your prototypes early; collectively we have a lot of experience and can offer hints which will save you time.

Help us focus our development efforts by telling us [what you are doing with
Blockly](https://goo.gl/forms/kZTsO9wGLmpoPXC02). The questionnaire only takes
a few minutes and will help us better support the Blockly community.
